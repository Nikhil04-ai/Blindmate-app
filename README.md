### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Get the required API key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Create a new API key (free)
   - Keep this key safe - you'll need it in step 3

2. **Set up the project in Replit**:
   - The project is already configured and ready to run
   - All dependencies are pre-installed

3. **Add your API key**:
   - Go to the Secrets tab in your Replit project
   - Add a new secret with key: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Paste your API key as the value

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Quick Setup (Automated)**:
   ```bash
   python setup-local.py
   ```
   This script will:
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies from `requirements-local.txt`
   - Create environment template file

2. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Clone or download the project
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd blindmate

   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate virtual environment
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-local.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///blindmate.db
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_session_key_here
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
5. **Access the application**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Allow camera and microphone permissions when prompted
   - The app will automatically initialize and start the voice interaction
