I'm building an accessibility web app called BlindMate for visually impaired users. It uses webcam feed, Coco SSD object detection (via TensorFlow.js), Gemini API for voice commands, and speech input/output via Web Speech API. The basic system is working.

Now I want you to upgrade and fix the following:

🔧 Fix Current Issues:

🟥 Draw Bounding Boxes for Detected Objects:

Problem: Coco SSD detects objects, but no boxes/labels are shown.

Solution: Add a <canvas> element over the webcam. Use ctx.strokeRect and ctx.fillText to draw real-time bounding boxes and class labels with confidence score.

🎤 Ask for Camera & Location Permission via Voice:

Problem: App doesn’t ask for camera/location through voice.

Solution: On page load, assistant should speak:
“Should I start detection, Sir?”
If user replies “yes”, request webcam using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia().
Then ask:
“Do you want to enable location?”
If “yes”, use navigator.geolocation to get current location.

🧠 Keep Gemini Assistant Active Continuously:

Problem: Currently user has to manually trigger Gemini.

Solution: Add a loop or interval that uses Web Speech API to continuously listen for voice input.

Add a wake phrase like “Hey BlindMate” to activate Gemini intent parsing.

🌐 Add Multilingual Voice Support:

Problem: Only English is supported.

Solution:

Use Web Speech API to detect or set language (hi-IN, ta-IN, etc).

Let user say: “Switch to Hindi” or choose from dropdown.

Convert Gemini response to user language using Gemini function or simple map and then speak it.

🗺️ Integrate Navigation Using Google Maps:

Problem: Navigation intent is not working.

Solution:

Use Google Maps JavaScript API + Directions API.

When Gemini returns: { action: "navigate", destination: "library" }, convert destination to coordinates using Places API, then get walking directions and read them aloud step-by-step.

🔊 Prevent TTS Overlap:

Problem: Too many speech outputs if objects are detected continuously.

Solution: Add a cooldown (e.g. 5 seconds) between each spoken output of detected object.

🚀 Suggested Improvements to Add:

Area	Feature
🔊 Voice Quality	Use natural Google voices (WaveNet) if possible
🌍 Language	Add Hindi, Bengali, Tamil speech support
🎙 Wake Word	Say “Hey BlindMate” to activate assistant
🧱 Object Priority	Announce only closest or most relevant object
🗣 Context	Say “Person 2 meters left” instead of flat object name
🧑‍🦯 Custom Training	Optional: Let user collect & upload stair/door images to fine-tune
🧪 Accessibility	Add ARIA roles, high-contrast mode, larger fonts
📜 Interaction Log	Show last 5 spoken commands + system responses for helper reference

📁 Tech Stack I’m Using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI: Coco SSD (TensorFlow.js) for object detection

Voice: Web Speech API for TTS + STT

Gemini Pro API (via Flask backend) for NLP

Navigation: Google Maps JS + Directions API

🎯 Output I Expect:

Updated index.html, app.js, styles.css

New logic for multilingual voice

Canvas overlay with bounding boxes

Voice flow for permission + Gemini integration

Google Maps navigation UI + voice output
